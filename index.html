<p>The principal goal of our proposal is to gain insight into terrorist strategies for choosing and attacking targets. To understand these modes of thinking we will build a mathematical model of an attack scenario. This model will consider the decisions that an adversary makes when faced with multiple choices for attack. The adversary will have to pick a resource allocation strategy that they believe achieves the highest probability of success for their chosen goal. We would like to learn how the goal was chosen and how these probabilities are learned/inferred. To simulate the model we will use online multiplayer games played by real people. The game play data will be analyzed to identify player types. Players will be characterized by their goals and strategies that should reflect their inference of the success probabilities. Furthermore, using our models under the parameters obtained through the playable game, we develop algorithms to compute the “best” strategy pairs for both the defenders and the attackers. These algorithms and the playable game will then be used to train the first responders in securing infrastructure networks.</p>

<p>The difference and the advantage of our approach is the existence of dynamically and randomly moving external targets (crowd behavior) that we include in our model. </p>

<p>We believe that our decision support tool will reduce the risk since it is a game theoretic approach that counters the need for adaptation to the dynamic behavior of the terrorism events and adversarial decision making process of terrorists.  The crowds are also considered to be targets in the game and since they are moving over time they are dynamically moving targets. I give one example that is currently used to secure an airport below. Even in this example we see that the current approach is static and does not consider crowd behavior.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-are-alternative-approaches" class="anchor" href="#what-are-alternative-approaches" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What are alternative approaches?</h3>

<p>One approach for securable places and not for soft targets (such as shopping malls, transit facilities, school grounds, etc.) is to decide on where to set up the security gates to identify and arrest people arriving with illicit fire arms, drugs, etc. This is called an interdiction game, because your opponents guessing where you might set up the gate may try to develop their own strategy to avoid detection.   ARMOR (Paruchuri et al. (2007, 2008, 2005, 2006); Pita et al. (2008)), casts the interdiction problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game (Basar and Olsder (1999)), and has been deployed to secure the Los Angeles International Airport. However, this model is different than our problem since we are trying to secure soft targets, and also this is a static problem in the sense that it is solved every day with new parameters and the payoff functions for players remain the same throughout the day. It is not changed according to the some dynamically changing parameter. </p>

<p>There are some research on other network interdiction games, secrecy and deception, passenger classification, placement of suicide bomber detectors in a grid structure. However, these are all static situations and I am not sure if any one of the has been implemented.</p>

<p>The examples are the Mumbai and Madrid attacks, even the Sandyhook and other campus attacks that the attackers went after the masses. We believe that if our tool was able there would have been less human casualties.</p>
